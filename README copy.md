# Factors Affecting Student Stress Levels

This was my first project in Data Science and made me rethink everything I
assumed about statistics and data visualization. I chose to explore the factors
that affected student stress levels in university. The major factors were
narrowed down to:

-   Study mode (Remote/Online)

-   Number of units taken by student

-   Subject/Major

## Stress about Course Load wrt Number of Study Units taken:

This graph suggests that higher the number of units a student takes, higher is
the stress they feel about having a large course load. This is quite an expected
outcome.

## Stress about Course Difficulty wrt Number of Study Units taken

We see here that students opting for lesser number of units feel that their
study units are quite hard while students with more units are relatively less
stressed about the course difficulty. This is an interesting result as one would
think people with higher course load would find studies much more difficult.

## Overall Stress wrt Number of Study Units taken:

The surprising pattern continues from the last graph. Students with lesser
number of study units ended up feeling more stressed about their overall studies
and university life.

In conclusion, this shows us that stress levels donâ€™t follow the conventional
logic of higher the number of study units, harder is the course and harder one
needs to study.
